# TransparentScreenshotHTML
Fork of TransparentScreenshot that runs in your browser.
Converted from C# to JavaScript/HTML by ChatGPT. CSS Styling [going to be] 100% by themirrazz.

## Update: I am learning C#
And I plan on sometime making a C# interpreter written in JavaScript. If and when I make this interpreter, this fork will be re-written to use the original C# source code with minor tweaks to make it more web compatible.
